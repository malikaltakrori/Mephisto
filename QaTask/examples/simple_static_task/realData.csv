"Like most other Third World conflicts of the twentieth century, the wars in Angola were heavily affected by the Cold War. In addition to the competition between the US and the USSR, several other factors motivated the involvement of international powers: the Sino-Soviet split, Third World solidarity against Western exploitation and imperialism, and in the case of the US, Angola’s large oil reserves. The USSR was involved with the MPLA from its foundation in the late-1950s. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> During these visits the MPLA developed a relationship with the Soviets, securing funding and in 1961 the explicit support of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who stated that “the patriots of Angola can be sure that the sympathies of the peoples of the great Soviet Union are fully on their side.” Many MPLA leaders would go on to be educated in Moscow. The USSR chose to support the MPLA over rival movements in Angola for a number of reasons.","Starting in 1958, MPLA founding member Mário de Andrade would travel to Moscow on a regular basis for various conferences and meetings.","Starting in 1958, its founding member Mário de Andrade would fly around Moscow on a regular basis for his conferences and meetings.","Starting in 1958, MPLA founding member Mário de Andrade would travel to Moscow on a regular basis for various conferences and meetings."
"The FNLA soldiers [were] slathering animals.” Though consistently armed by the US and China and supported by troops and artillery from Mobutu’s Zaire, the FNLA was not able to maintain military success against the Cuban-backed MPLA and ceased to be a major force in Angolan politics after 1976, The União Nacional para a Indêpendencia Total de Angola (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) was a latecomer in the independence struggle, formed in 1966 by Jonas Savimbi. A Swiss- and Portuguese-educated Angolan émigré of Ovimbundu descent, Savimbi was for a time a member on the FNLA but left the organization in 1964. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Seeking to create a nationalist movement for his own people, Savimbi formed UNITA, basing his power among the Ovimbundu capital of Huambo. UNITA received aid from the US and South Africa for most of its existence and espoused an anti-communist agenda, though Savimbi had himself been a Marxist at one time. After being defeated right after independence UNITA retreated deep into the Angolan bush and built up an army of several thousand men with fanatically loyal officers.","The Mbundu and Bakongo ethnic groups dominated the MPLA and FNLA leadership, while the largest group, the Ovimbundu, had limited representation.","The Mbundu and Bakongo ethnic groups dominated the MPLA and FNLA leadership, while the largest group, the Ovimbundu, had limited representation.","The Mbundu and related ethnic groups dominated the military and FNLA leadership, while the largest group, the Ovimbundu, had limited representation."

"Conventional dressers tend to be “conventional” people– drab and sometimes boring, risk averse and lacking in confidence, they tend to be introverts who like to blend in with the crowd. Sloppy dressers generally look as if they slept in the clothes they are wearing. Their wrinkled, soiled, mismatched outfits, often including torn, frayed blue jeans and deliberately ripped T- shirts are usually topped off by unwashed, uncombed hair, unshaven faces and –on women-heavy, sloppily applied makeup. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> ","The “Grunge” look is the uniform of the “Anti-establishment,” and while those who sport this style tend to view themselves as free-thinkers who reject conventional norms, the look also screams of a poor self-image, immaturity, lack of motivation, and an “I don’t give a damn” attitude that others will assume-often correctly-carries over into every aspect of a person’s life-from job performance, to work ethic and personal relationships.","The “Grunge” look is the uniform of the “Anti-establishment,” and while those who sport this style tend to view themselves as free-thinkers who reject conventional norms, the look also screams of a poor self-image, immaturity, lack of motivation, and an “I don’t give a damn” attitude that others will assume-often correctly-carries over into every aspect of a person’s life-from job performance, to work ethic and personal relationships.","The “Grunge” look is the uniform for the “Anti-establishment,” and while those who sport the expression tend to view these as free-thinkers that reject conventional norms, the look also speaks of a poor public -image, ego , lack of motivation respect and an “I don’t know a damn” attitude that others will assume-often correctly- carry over into every aspect of a person’s woman -from to performance, to work ethic experience personal romantic ."
"Not everyone is an expert on style, certainly. We all know what we like, and our personalities will permeate our individual choices, but how can we predict with any degree of certainty how our style of dress will affect others, or, conversely, how other’s appearance may impact our opinions without our knowledge or conscious participation in the process? Surprisingly, the answers to these issues are not all that difficult to come by. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Here are just a few examples of some styles of dress that are popular today and the kinds of information they can convey about those who wear them. The conventional dresser dresses for his environment rather than from a sense of personal style. In the business world the conventional dresser is the man or woman wearing a simple, traditionally styled suit in blue, gray or black with a white or pale pastel shirt, conservative tie and sensible shoes.","The same research that provides us with so much information (albeit with very few conclusions) about personality development also helps us to recognize how our outward appearance reflects our personality to others.","The same research that provides us with so much information (albeit with very few conclusions) about personality development also helps us to recognize how our outward appearance reflects our personality to others.","The same research which provides us with as much insight (albeit with very few facts ) about personality development also requires us to recognize how our physical appearance reflects our personality to others."
"In the 1990s Zaire served as the main supporter of UNITA, as South African and American support for the organization dwindled. In 1997 a coup supported in part by the Angolan government overthrew Mobutu, and Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Without the aggressive Mobutu régime as a neighborhood, the situation in Angola stabilized and the MPLA was finally able to crack down on internal dissent without being troubled with foreign intervention, ending the civil war a few years later in 2002. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> In addition to the competition between the US and the USSR, several other factors motivated the involvement of international powers: the Sino-Soviet split, Third World solidarity against Western exploitation and imperialism, and in the case of the US, Angola’s large oil reserves.

"There are certainly other issues with over reliance on NGO services, such as the fact that their services often don't solve the underlying infrastructure issues that will reemerge once the NGO presence is reduced. Many NGOs do not remain in-country for the post-conflict period. In effect, services are provided and once the initial emergency is over, the NGOs are gone and those still displaced must find a health provider somewhere else. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Another issue is the added levels of coordination that occur when working with multiple aid groups to ensure healthcare service coverage. NGO involvement in IDP aid is a fact of life, however. The critical point is that the Ministry of Health must coordinate among those organizations.","This affects a country's capacity to rebuild post-conflict as well as their ability to provide services while the rebuilding effort is underway.","This affects a government 's capacity to rebuild post-conflict and well as their ability to provide services while its rebuilding effort is underway.","This affects a country's capacity to rebuild post-conflict as well as their ability to provide services while the rebuilding effort is underway."
"The USSR chose to support the MPLA over rival movements in Angola for a number of reasons. As a left-leaning Marxist movement that explicitly condemned the imperial powers, the MPLA followed the same basic ideological principles as the USSR. The UPA/FNLA was more ambiguous on this issue, receiving support from the US and sometimes practicing anti-communist rhetoric. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> The USSR also practiced the policy of recognizing and supporting only one rebel movement within a conflict, a policy not shared by all of its peers. Early Soviet support of the MPLA included food and clothing as well as weapons and increased progressively during the course of the war from goods valued at $25,000 in 1961 to $220,000 in 1973. Large scale Soviet assistance did not come until 1975 though.","The MPLA was also not as focused on regional or ethnic issues, as the predominately Bakongo UPA based in northern Angola was.","The MPLA was also not as focused on regional or ethnic issues, as the predominately Bakongo UPA based in northern Angola was.","The MPLA was generally regarded as focused on regional or ethnic issues, were the predominately Bakongo UPA based in northern Angola was."
"And even fewer public school systems allow for classes and tutoring that is written into the curriculum or that is at the very least affordable for working students of parents. SAT courses such as Kaplan and Princeton Review, while popular, are extremely expensive such as $1000 for average cheap courses. These classes tend to be attended by sophomores, juniors, and senior high school students. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Another important comparison is knowledge of and access to such schools. In Japan, the juku crams schools are expensive. Some schools rate very high for acceptance to top high schools and top universities, while others rate lower on the scale.","In comparison to the juku cram schools in Japan which would be attended from about age 13 during junior high or even earlier and throughout high school.","In comparison to the juku cram schools in Japan which would be attended from about age 13 during junior high or even earlier and throughout high school.","no comparison to other juku cram schools in Japan which would are attended from about age 5 in junior high or even earlier and throughout high school."
"Through the entire course of conflict in Angola from 1961 to 2002, foreign powers were involved in various degrees, from direct military assistance to monetary and diplomatic backing of one or more of the internal movements. Ranging from global superpowers like the United States and the Soviet Union to regional players like South Africa and Zaire, numerous countries entered the conflict and complicated the situation. American, Soviet, and Chinese involvement were rooted primarily in the existential Cold War struggle of ideologies and global geopolitics, with economic interests also playing a major role for the United States. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> The changing nature of world politics would alter the course of the war and most of the major powers would withdraw from Angola in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Chief among the regional powers involved in Angola were Zaire and South Africa. Both countries had strong motivations for their presence in Angola and importantly the means to affect the course of the war.","Regional powers were influenced by the superpowers and motivated by a number of other factors as well.","Regional powers were influenced by the superpowers and motivated by a number of other factors as well.","Regional powers were influenced by the superpowers , motivated through a range of other factors as well."

Large scale Soviet assistance did not come until 1975 though. In this year another foreign power would join the equation, with Cuba’s shipment of two shiploads of T-55 tanks and 500 military advisories. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Cuba was not simply a Soviet proxy but rather had its own agenda for being in Angola. As a Third World country with a colonial past and communist government, Cuba wanted to sustain the global conflict against the West and imperialism through spreading Marxist-Leninist revolution.","Though the Cubans and Soviets would work together closely in Angola, early actions were not coordinated as is widely assumed.","Though the Cubans / Soviets would work together early in Angola, early actions had not successful as is widely assumed.","Though the Cubans and Soviets would work together closely in Angola, early actions were not coordinated as is widely assumed."

"In LA County prep schools for American standardized testing are not always readily available.

"Reproductive Health funding problems underscore a larger issue with a reliance on NGO services, as can often be seen in IDP situations. The ability to provide services is often reliant on funding from outside sources and its continuation is based not on the needs of those being served, but on what they can find funding to provide.
