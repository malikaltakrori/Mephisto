"q_4","Nepal was embroiled in a bloody civil war from 1996 until 2006. Surprisingly, however, they are still on track to meet 16 of the 19 Millennium Development Goals by 2015. While they are unlikely to meet the reproductive health targets, some of the goals Nepal is on track to meet include under-five and maternal mortality targets and disease-specific goals (halting the spread of HIV and malaria). The question is, how was Nepal able to meet these targets even when dealing with civil conflict and internally displaced people? Devotka and van Teijlingen identify multiple reasons why Nepal was successful even during such trying times. Some of the relevant items with regard to maintaining and strengthening health systems include:Neither side purposely disrupted health systems during the conflict. Though the conflict led to a decrease in service utilization, due to access problems, the rebels overall looked favorably on health services and made no efforts to deny access to citizens during the fighting. The rebels made an effort to ensure health clinics in their area were still sufficiently staffed and supplied. Most clinics in rebel-held areas were sufficiently staffed and had supplies. While many of the clinics were operated without trained health professionals, they still received regular training and supplies. Key actors increased coordination in response to the conflict, while maintaining a low profile. Regular meetings continued between the Ministry of Health (MOH) and community officials. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> The one issue identified here, however, is the lack of clarity coming from the country level to all actors. While provisions were made for free care to poor citizens, criteria as to who qualified was not laid out to clinics. Similarly, communication between the MOH and international organizations was not identified as a strength of the program. Public health and more traditional service providers also increased their efforts during the conflict. In addition, community clinics were handed over to the communities to manage, as the federal government did not have adequate resources to manage them during the conflict. Programming for the elderly and indigent was increased, and many traditional female “attendants” saw their role increased. GDP in the country continued to rise during the extended conflict, and infrastructure improvements likely also contributed. These factors likely helped the country stay on track for the MDGs. The infrastructure improvements (roads and electricity) likely improved access for many citizens. There are clear lessons for developing a health systems strengthening approach in other conflict situations here. Namely, commitment from both sides of the conflict to not disrupting the health provision infrastructure in the country is key. Ensuring clinics still run and funds are in place can help to minimize the effects of access and migration. In addition, the government must be able to hand off some of the management to provincial or community levels, especially in rebel-held zones where they have limited access. So what are the takeaways from the Nepal case study?","In addition, the international organizations that responded by providing services kept a low profile.","According to Ms. Caproni, “In the ever-changing world of modern communications technologies, however, the FBI and other government agencies are facing a potentially widening gap between our legal authority to intercept electronics communications pursuant to court order and our hypothetical ability to actually intercept those communications.","atten"
"q_5","The possibility that Internet users will be able to hide what they do from the ubiquitous ad tracking is a big win for consumers concerned with Internet privacy. Lawmakers have heralded the bill as a companion to the “Do Not Call” registry that was introduced in 2003. The registry prevented telemarketers from calling consumers who chose to opt-out from telemarketing calls. The “Do Not Track” bill would similarly force advertisers to respect the privacy of users who do not want their online activity to be subject to ad network tracking for marketing purposes. According to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), the bill’s sponsor, “Consumers have a right to determine what if any of their information is shared with big corporations, and the federal government must have the authority and tools to enforce reasonable protections.” The “Do Not Track” bill would give the FTC eighteen months to come up with a set of enforceable privacy protection regulations for online ad network tracking. Some, like Ryan Calo, director of Stanford Law School’s Consumer Privacy Project, believe the bill does not go far enough. For one, he said, the bill only applied to those who chose to opt-out from ad network tracking. It does not affect those who do not know that they can or do not know how. This objection is partially overruled as the newest edition of the Firefox browser makes prevalent a “Do Not Track Me” option said to be the response to this and other similar bills. FBI Wants to Expand Internet WiretappingThe FBI, in an effort to keep up with the changing landscape of the Internet, is calling for a push to expand its capabilities in intercepting online evidence. Citing advances in “webmail, social networking sites, and peer-to-peer services,” the FBI’s general counsel, Valerie Caproni, addressed Congress to discuss the increasing difficulty in tracing electronic communication in ongoing cases. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> As the gap between authority and capability widens, the government is increasingly unable to collect valuable evidence in cases ranging from child exploitation and pornography to organized crime and drug trafficking to terrorism and espionage.” The FBI argues that the current limitations on their wiretapping are antiquated. Many statutes have not been updated since the early nineties. Some of the statutes allow the FBI to read e-mail stored on a local server that is more than six months old. These laws date back to a time when users fetched their mail from a single computer almost daily, so e-mail that had been on a server for six months was considered abandoned. In the age of webmail, users keep most of their emails forever.","According to Ms. Caproni, “In the ever-changing world of modern communications technologies, however, the FBI and other government agencies are facing a potentially widening gap between our legal authority to intercept electronic communications pursuant to court order and our practical ability to actually intercept those communications.","In addition, the international organizations that responded by providing services kept a low profile.","atten"
"q_1","My question dealt with the fact that it takes a certain amount of time for a bone that has a fracture to heal. I stated that the body needs a specific amount of time to transfer calcium from locations in the body to the fracture. I also mentioned that the cells that build up the various tissues found within the bone have to grow and divide and repeat this process until the fracture was knitted. I was concerned because this took time and that it was an actual physical process – there are no shortcuts. Also, I did not understand how a broken bone could be considered not real. Barbara assured me that fractures could heal “instantaneously” and that the body was not limited by time or resources since God was perfect and that matter was not real. I wanted to know how the healing process worked. Within the Church there are two types of healers. One is called a Practitioner and the other type is referred to as a Christian Science Nurse. A Practitioner begins by becoming a member of the Christian Science Church. A member does all the regular things, attends weekly Sunday services and on Wednesday nights twice a month, there are testimonials where members speak about their experiences with healing. Once the member feels that he or she is ready to become a Practitioner, they take a two week-long course. This course is referred to as “The Class.”  Once “The Class” is completed, the member is now a Practitioner and can begin to heal. The Practitioner uses the 700 page Science and Health text as well as Bible verses to discuss with people how to let God (aka “Mind” or “Spirit”) to be reflected accurately in their bodies. These Practitioners set their own fees and can provide services either in person or via the phone. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> The students spend their time analyzing texts, understanding how to explain health concerns from a religious standpoint and praying. “To the Christian Science healer, sickness is a dream from which the patient needs to be awakened. Disease should not appear real to the physician, since it is demonstrable that the way to cure the patient is to make disease unreal to him.” (Science and Health p. 417)Christian Science Nurses, do not go through training at all, and are merely members who help with physical concerns during the “Christian Science treatment.”  Barbara let me know that many nurses have taken “The Class” but they prefer to help other members in this path instead. All treatment that is provided by Christian Science Nurses is nonmedical in nature and includes care such as help with feeding, bathing, assistance with moving (i.e. from bed to chair).  Simple medical tasks such as blood pressure measuring, temperature taking, or applying cold/hot compresses are not included in their duties, and are expressly not permitted both by the church and by law.","This treatment is called “Christian Science treatment.”  Within “The Class”, the students do not learn about diseases or how to classify symptoms.","Please choose the "Content fully preserved" option","atten"

"q_6","The research I read taught me a lot about insomnia. I learned that anxiety and physical tension seem to be the main focuses of the drugs in reducing insomnia or time spent trying to fall asleep. I also learned that economic and cultural factors differ for those with insomnia. And that women have higher rates of insomnia across almost all cultures. As a female, I am at risk for insomnia more than a male would be. In order to reduce the risk of experiencing the symptoms of insomnia, I think that it would be important to focus on my bedroom as a place of sleep. I could possibly study in the dining room, which I do sometimes. This would be one way to reduce the environmental cue of my bedroom as a place of concentration and focus. Studying in a different room would allow for my bedroom to be a place that I could associate with relaxation, which is not always the case. Another thing I could try is to try relaxing and clearing my thoughts before sleeping, such as learning some meditation techniques. I would not want to try using benzodiazepines, I do not really take any pharmaceutical drugs, but I would be willing, perhaps, to attempt to cease consuming any caffeine at an hour later than noon. I usually drink a cup of Yerba Mate tea before I study. And at times I drink about 2 or 3 cups. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> But without it I have a lot of trouble focusing. Overall, I did not learn that my family is at risk, but I was better able to notice that we can sometimes have strange sleeping habits which are most likely related to environmental stressors. Insomnia and Biological and Sociocultural Models Page numbers Ignoring the influence of Asian influenced education on American society is nearly impossible. On the surface, the masses comment on certain Asian student groups (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean students) as being smarter than other American ethnic minority populations and as scoring higher or equal to Anglo Americans on standardized tests. As many current ethnic studies courses teach, it is not a nationality or an ethnicity that one is born into that determines grades, study habits, test scores, education levels and job opportunities but it is rather cultural advice and traditions that give rise to how a parent makes use of resources for their child’s education. The educational systems in many Asian countries differ greatly from those in the United States; there are many countries that demand high standardized exam scores from a student in order for graduation and advancement to the next stage of schooling (such as middle school to high school and high school to college). Because of the demands of these school systems, the students are expected to not only score good in classes, but to learn how to take standardized exams very well.","While Yerba Mate has about a third the amount of caffeine as coffee, it tends to make me very alert and focused on whatever the task is I need to complete.","In addition, community clinics were handed over to the communities to manage, as the federal government did not have adequate resources to manage them during the conflict.","atten"
