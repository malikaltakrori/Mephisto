"203","In comparison to American schools such as those in Los Angeles County, there are schools such as preparatory and some private schools that prepare students early on for SAT. And even fewer public school systems allow for classes and tutoring that is written into the curriculum or that is at the very least affordable for working students of parents. SAT courses such as Kaplan and Princeton Review, while popular, are extremely expensive such as $1000 for average cheap courses. These classes tend to be attended by sophomores, juniors, and senior high school students. In comparison to the juku cram schools in Japan which would be attended from about age 13 during junior high or even earlier and throughout high school. Another important comparison is knowledge of and access to such schools. In Japan, the juku crams schools are expensive. Some schools rate very high for acceptance to top high schools and top universities, while others rate lower on the scale. But nonetheless, the students learn from such schools about standardized testing very early on. The affordability of these schools varies. And juku schools are more of a common knowledge for parents. If a parent in Japan cannot afford or decides not to send their own child to juku, it is likely that the student will know at least some other friends that do attend juku or will at least be given other means through knowledge of the parent to pass exams early on (such as providing textbooks or a private tutor). Juku allows for dangerous competition between students in the face of college entrance. Rohlen mentions that such competition even leads to student suicide at times. Juku systems began as a means of increasing public school comparisons to private schools. The study of juku school systems was recently studied by scholars in the 1980s. The juku focus is on primarily one subject area such as history, language, or science, or math. The school will not focus on details or information such as what may be found outside of the entrance exams. Juku also differ from one another, such as the shingaku juku, where the top students attend, or hoshu juku where the students use the juku school to catch up if they are behind other students in their regular school evaluations. In LA County prep schools for American standardized testing are not always readily available. They are extremely expensive, and the student may even begin to start the classes much too late to learn the material for an exam such as the SAT adequately. In many instances students and parents alike are not taught much about how important the SAT exam is. Because the school system is different in Japan in comparison to the USA, the standardized testing preparation follows that pattern. In Japan standardized testing really drives many important aspects of a student’s future. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> ","In the US a student can do poorly on the SAT and still go to a community college and then graduate from a UC and possibly be admitted to a prestigious university afterwards for a Masters or PhD degree.","In the US a student can score poorly on the SAT and still go to a community school and then withdraw with the UC but possibly be admitted to a prestigious university afterwards for a master or PhD degree.","LSB"
"186","From Freud and Jung’s psychoanalytic theories to the behavioral interpretations of Skinner and Rodgers, the different schools of psychological thought strive to explain the perplexing and all too often contradictory motives behind human behavior–unfortunately, often with negligible concrete results. In fact, in the world of psychology, where so much of what goes on inside each individual’s psyche is carefully hidden behind ego defenses, habitual behaviors, and socially dictated norms, how we dress–from the clothes we wear to the way we style our hair and decorate our bodies–is one of only a very few clear indicators of an individual’s personality, self–image and at times even his or her world view. In every sense of the word, we “dress to impress,”— to make a statement to the world about who we are and how we want the world to see us. But what are we saying with what we wear? Not everyone is an expert on style, certainly. We all know what we like, and our personalities will permeate our individual choices, but how can we predict with any degree of certainty how our style of dress will affect others, or, conversely, how other’s appearance may impact our opinions without our knowledge or conscious participation in the process? Surprisingly, the answers to these issues are not all that difficult to come by. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Here are just a few examples of some styles of dress that are popular today and the kinds of information they can convey about those who wear them. The conventional dresser dresses for his environment rather than from a sense of personal style. In the business world the conventional dresser is the man or woman wearing a simple, traditionally styled suit in blue, gray or black with a white or pale pastel shirt, conservative tie and sensible shoes. On college campuses he or she is usually in a pair of chinos and a button down shirt, topped off by perhaps a “V” neck sweater and a pair of loafers. Conventional dressers tend to be “conventional” people– drab and sometimes boring, risk averse and lacking in confidence, they tend to be introverts who like to blend in with the crowd. Sloppy dressers generally look as if they slept in the clothes they are wearing. Their wrinkled, soiled, mismatched outfits, often including torn, frayed blue jeans and deliberately ripped T- shirts are usually topped off by unwashed, uncombed hair, unshaven faces and –on women-heavy, sloppily applied makeup. The “Grunge” look is the uniform of the “Anti-establishment,” and while those who sport this style tend to view themselves as free-thinkers who reject conventional norms, the look also screams of a poor self-image, immaturity, lack of motivation, and an “I don’t give a damn” attitude that others will assume-often correctly-carries over into every aspect of a person’s life-from job performance, to work ethic and personal relationships.","The same research that provides us with so much information (albeit with very few conclusions) about personality development also helps us to recognize how our outward appearance reflects our personality to others.","The same research which provides us with as much insight (albeit with very few facts ) about personality development also requires us to recognize how our physical appearance reflects our personality to others.","LSB"
"184","In the 1990s Zaire served as the main supporter of UNITA, as South African and American support for the organization dwindled. In 1997 a coup supported in part by the Angolan government overthrew Mobutu, and Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Without the aggressive Mobutu régime as a neighborhood, the situation in Angola stabilized and the MPLA was finally able to crack down on internal dissent without being troubled with foreign intervention, ending the civil war a few years later in 2002. Like most other Third World conflicts of the twentieth century, the wars in Angola were heavily affected by the Cold War. In addition to the competition between the US and the USSR, several other factors motivated the involvement of international powers: the Sino-Soviet split, Third World solidarity against Western exploitation and imperialism, and in the case of the US, Angola’s large oil reserves. The USSR was involved with the MPLA from its foundation in the late-1950s. Starting in 1958, MPLA founding member Mário de Andrade would travel to Moscow on a regular basis for various conferences and meetings. During these visits the MPLA developed a relationship with the Soviets, securing funding and in 1961 the explicit support of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who stated that “the patriots of Angola can be sure that the sympathies of the peoples of the great Soviet Union are fully on their side.” Many MPLA leaders would go on to be educated in Moscow. The USSR chose to support the MPLA over rival movements in Angola for a number of reasons. As a left-leaning Marxist movement that explicitly condemned the imperial powers, the MPLA followed the same basic ideological principles as the USSR. The UPA/FNLA was more ambiguous on this issue, receiving support from the US and sometimes practicing anti-communist rhetoric. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> The USSR also practiced the policy of recognizing and supporting only one rebel movement within a conflict, a policy not shared by all of its peers. Early Soviet support of the MPLA included food and clothing as well as weapons and increased progressively during the course of the war from goods valued at $25,000 in 1961 to $220,000 in 1973. Large scale Soviet assistance did not come until 1975 though. In this year another foreign power would join the equation, with Cuba’s shipment of two shiploads of T-55 tanks and 500 military advisories. Though the Cubans and Soviets would work together closely in Angola, early actions were not coordinated as is widely assumed. Cuba was not simply a Soviet proxy but rather had its own agenda for being in Angola. As a Third World country with a colonial past and communist government, Cuba wanted to sustain the global conflict against the West and imperialism through spreading Marxist-Leninist revolution.","The MPLA was also not as focused on regional or ethnic issues, as the predominately Bakongo UPA based in northern Angola was.","The MPLA was generally regarded as focused on regional or ethnic issues, were the predominately Bakongo UPA based in northern Angola was.","LSB"
"177","In addition, According to N Hakamies, “Although material and human resources are significant constraints on agencies, the main challenge is to tackle ideological, managerial and policy barriers, and those related to donor influence.” Finding funding for family planning services continues to prove difficult for NGOs, and as a result they often do not exist or cannot meet the need levels of their constituencies. Reproductive Health funding problems underscore a larger issue with a reliance on NGO services, as can often be seen in IDP situations. The ability to provide services is often reliant on funding from outside sources and its continuation is based not on the needs of those being served, but on what they can find funding to provide. Often an organization's decision to cease operations in a country has more to do with a lack of financial support than the successful completion of their programming. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Many NGOs do not remain in-country for the post-conflict period. In effect, services are provided and once the initial emergency is over, the NGOs are gone and those still displaced must find a health provider somewhere else. This affects a country's capacity to rebuild post-conflict as well as their ability to provide services while the rebuilding effort is underway. Another issue is the added levels of coordination that occur when working with multiple aid groups to ensure healthcare service coverage. NGO involvement in IDP aid is a fact of life, however. The critical point is that the Ministry of Health must coordinate among those organizations. Much of the focus on healthcare provision during emergency and conflict situations revolves around the use of Mobile Health Units (MHUs). Mobile Health Units are, at their most basic, mobile service units that usually provide specific forms of both preventative and curative care. They are generally expensive, however, and the fact that they only provide services intermittently tends to affect when they are appropriate for use. According to Stephane du Mortier and Rudi Coninx, “In situations of armed conflict, the range of PHC services that can be provided is severely restricted. This means that, in any given situation, it is essential to select the priority services among the spectrum of PHC services”. MHUs are limited in the number of services they can provide and the frequency at which they are available to any one community. These considerations must be kept in mind when formulating a plan as to how to use MHUs in any conflict or emergency setting. Du Mortier and Coninx describe their use of MHUs with the International Committee of the Red Cross during the conflict in Columbia in 2005. In this case, the rebel forces refused to allow access to the Ministry of Health in the country to citizens in areas they held.","There are certainly other issues with over reliance on NGO services, such as the fact that their services often don't solve the underlying infrastructure issues that will reemerge once the NGO presence is reduced.","There are several other issues with over reliance on NGO services, such as the fact that their services often don't solve the underlying health issues which will reemerge once .","LSB"
"176","The FNLA soldiers [were] slathering animals.” Though consistently armed by the US and China and supported by troops and artillery from Mobutu’s Zaire, the FNLA was not able to maintain military success against the Cuban-backed MPLA and ceased to be a major force in Angolan politics after 1976, The União Nacional para a Indêpendencia Total de Angola (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) was a latecomer in the independence struggle, formed in 1966 by Jonas Savimbi. A Swiss- and Portuguese-educated Angolan émigré of Ovimbundu descent, Savimbi was for a time a member on the FNLA but left the organization in 1964. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Seeking to create a nationalist movement for his own people, Savimbi formed UNITA, basing his power among the Ovimbundu capital of Huambo. UNITA received aid from the US and South Africa for most of its existence and espoused an anti-communist agenda, though Savimbi had himself been a Marxist at one time. After being defeated right after independence UNITA retreated deep into the Angolan bush and built up an army of several thousand men with fanatically loyal officers. Savimbi’s charisma and previous training in China helped him build an effective fighting force that challenged the MPLA for over twenty-five years. However, the fact that UNITA was built around Savimbi meant that after his death the movement disintegrated. Through the entire course of conflict in Angola from 1961 to 2002, foreign powers were involved in various degrees, from direct military assistance to monetary and diplomatic backing of one or more of the internal movements. Ranging from global superpowers like the United States and the Soviet Union to regional players like South Africa and Zaire, numerous countries entered the conflict and complicated the situation. American, Soviet, and Chinese involvement were rooted primarily in the existential Cold War struggle of ideologies and global geopolitics, with economic interests also playing a major role for the United States. Regional powers were influenced by the superpowers and motivated by a number of other factors as well. The changing nature of world politics would alter the course of the war and most of the major powers would withdraw from Angola in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Chief among the regional powers involved in Angola were Zaire and South Africa. Both countries had strong motivations for their presence in Angola and importantly the means to affect the course of the war. The rise of Black Nationalism and the decolonization of many countries in the region posed a major threat to the survival of the apartheid régime of South Africa. Politically and economically based on a persistent system of racial oppression and exploitation, South Africa, as well as the other remaining settler colony, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), was under heavy international pressure to grant rights to its African majority and faced various boycotts and trade embargos as a result.","The Mbundu and Bakongo ethnic groups dominated the MPLA and FNLA leadership, while the largest group, the Ovimbundu, had limited representation.","The Mbundu and related ethnic groups dominated the military and FNLA leadership, while the largest group, the Ovimbundu, had limited representation.","LSB"
