"69","Nepal was embroiled in a bloody civil war from 1996 until 2006. Surprisingly, however, they are still on track to meet 16 of the 19 Millennium Development Goals by 2015. While they are unlikely to meet the reproductive health targets, some of the goals Nepal is on track to meet include under-five and maternal mortality targets and disease-specific goals (halting the spread of HIV and malaria). The question is, how was Nepal able to meet these targets even when dealing with civil conflict and internally displaced people? Devotka and van Teijlingen identify multiple reasons why Nepal was successful even during such trying times. Some of the relevant items with regard to maintaining and strengthening health systems include:Neither side purposely disrupted health systems during the conflict. Though the conflict led to a decrease in service utilization, due to access problems, the rebels overall looked favorably on health services and made no efforts to deny access to citizens during the fighting. The rebels made an effort to ensure health clinics in their area were still sufficiently staffed and supplied. Most clinics in rebel-held areas were sufficiently staffed and had supplies. While many of the clinics were operated without trained health professionals, they still received regular training and supplies. Key actors increased coordination in response to the conflict, while maintaining a low profile. Regular meetings continued between the Ministry of Health (MOH) and community officials. In addition, the international organizations that responded by providing services kept a low profile. The one issue identified here, however, is the lack of clarity coming from the country level to all actors. While provisions were made for free care to poor citizens, criteria as to who qualified was not laid out to clinics. Similarly, communication between the MOH and international organizations was not identified as a strength of the program. Public health and more traditional service providers also increased their efforts during the conflict. In addition, community clinics were handed over to the communities to manage, as the federal government did not have adequate resources to manage them during the conflict. Programming for the elderly and indigent was increased, and many traditional female “attendants” saw their role increased. GDP in the country continued to rise during the extended conflict, and infrastructure improvements likely also contributed. These factors likely helped the country stay on track for the MDGs. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> There are clear lessons for developing a health systems strengthening approach in other conflict situations here.

In addition, the government must be able to hand off some of the management to provincial or community levels, especially in rebel-held zones where they have limited access.

"196","The possibility that Internet users will be able to hide what they do from the ubiquitous ad tracking is a big win for consumers concerned with Internet privacy. Lawmakers have heralded the bill as a companion to the “Do Not Call” registry that was introduced in 2003. The registry prevented telemarketers from calling consumers who chose to opt-out from telemarketing calls. The “Do Not Track” bill would similarly force advertisers to respect the privacy of users who do not want their online activity to be subject to ad network tracking for marketing purposes. According to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), the bill’s sponsor, “Consumers have a right to determine what if any of their information is shared with big corporations, and the federal government must have the authority and tools to enforce reasonable protections.” The “Do Not Track” bill would give the FTC eighteen months to come up with a set of enforceable privacy protection regulations for online ad network tracking. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> For one, he said, the bill only applied to those who chose to opt-out from ad network tracking. It does not affect those who do not know that they can or do not know how. This objection is partially overruled as the newest edition of the Firefox browser makes prevalent a “Do Not Track Me” option said to be the response to this and other similar bills. FBI Wants to Expand Internet WiretappingThe FBI, in an effort to keep up with the changing landscape of the Internet, is calling for a push to expand its capabilities in intercepting online evidence. Citing advances in “webmail, social networking sites, and peer-to-peer services,” the FBI’s general counsel, Valerie Caproni, addressed Congress to discuss the increasing difficulty in tracing electronic communication in ongoing cases. According to Ms. Caproni, “In the ever-changing world of modern communications technologies, however, the FBI and other government agencies are facing a potentially widening gap between our legal authority to intercept electronic communications pursuant to court order and our practical ability to actually intercept those communications. As the gap between authority and capability widens, the government is increasingly unable to collect valuable evidence in cases ranging from child exploitation and pornography to organized crime and drug trafficking to terrorism and espionage.” The FBI argues that the current limitations on their wiretapping are antiquated. Many statutes have not been updated since the early nineties. Some of the statutes allow the FBI to read e-mail stored on a local server that is more than six months old. These laws date back to a time when users fetched their mail from a single computer almost daily, so e-mail that had been on a server for six months was considered abandoned. In the age of webmail, users keep most of their emails forever.","Some, like Ryan Calo, director of Stanford Law School’s Consumer Privacy Project, believe the bill does not go far enough.","Some, paradox Ryan Calo, associate of Stanford Law School’s Consumer Privacy Project, believe the bill does not go far enough.","mutX"

"11","Increasing antagonism with the US meant that Cuba was also looking to foil American plans abroad, and the Angolan crisis was a perfect opportunity for Cuba to use its strong military to embarrass the US. Fidel Castro initially acted unilaterally and without notifying the Soviets on his intentions in Angola. However, Cuban and Soviet collaboration soon led to highly effective assistance to the MPLA, with the Cubans provided tens of thousands of well-trained soldiers and the Soviets technical expertise and military equipment, particularly in the field of heavy artillery and tanks, which were previously absent in the Angolan theater. By the 1980s, a Soviet investment of $5 billion in military hardware helped lead the MPLA to victory in the war. Weapons provided included “T-34 and T-54 tanks, 100mm guns, 120mm multiple rocket launchers, amphibious vehicles, helicopters equipped with 20mm cannon and air-to-ground rockets” as well as MIG-17 and MIG-21 fighter jets. Soviet and Cuban presence continued until the late 80s when global political changes and the end of the Cold War took away many of the incentives of remaining in Angola. Without Cuban and Soviet backing, the MPLA would have never been able to defeat its opponents, who also had the support of foreign superpowers. The initial reasons for United States intervention in Angola were primarily economic. American oil companies were well established there since the discovery of oil in the 1950s, and in order to protect these interests, the US supported the Portuguese during the liberation war. By the time the Portugal was preparing to leave the continent in 1974, the threat of communist takeover by the MPLA with Cuban and Soviet support influenced the US to fund alternative groups to prevent a communist victory. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Since 1961, the US had been supporting Holden Roberto with a modest stipend of $10,000 a year. In the light of the new situation, this sum was increased to $300,000 in 1975, and throughout that year $35 million was spent on arming the FNLA through airbases in friendly Zaire. US involvement was relatively clandestine at this stage, mostly involving the CIA and indirect aid to the FNLA through Zaire. An American population weary from Vietnam was not willing to enter another bloody Third World conflict so far from home. Despite the official backing of the FNLA, many within the US establishment did not agree with the decision to support the FNLA. Two important US officials in Luanda, Robert W. Hultslander, the CIA station chief, and Tom Killoran, the American Consul General, agreed that the MPLA were the most qualified of the groups to govern and sought peaceful relations with Washington. Hultslander further stated that its leaders “were more effective, better educated, better trained, and better motivated”; by contrast the FNLA “was led by corrupt, unprincipled men who represented the very worst of radical black African racism.”","A Soviet friendly nation in southern Africa might tip the balance of power in favor of the communists and set off more leftist revolutions in the region.","A Soviet nation in South Africa could increase the balance of power for the communists and create more leftist revolutions in the region.","BT"
"155"," <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Finding funding for family planning services continues to prove difficult for NGOs, and as a result they often do not exist or cannot meet the need levels of their constituencies. Reproductive Health funding problems underscore a larger issue with a reliance on NGO services, as can often be seen in IDP situations. The ability to provide services is often reliant on funding from outside sources and its continuation is based not on the needs of those being served, but on what they can find funding to provide. Often an organization's decision to cease operations in a country has more to do with a lack of financial support than the successful completion of their programming. There are certainly other issues with over reliance on NGO services, such as the fact that their services often don't solve the underlying infrastructure issues that will reemerge once the NGO presence is reduced. Many NGOs do not remain in-country for the post-conflict period. In effect, services are provided and once the initial emergency is over, the NGOs are gone and those still displaced must find a health provider somewhere else. This affects a country's capacity to rebuild post-conflict as well as their ability to provide services while the rebuilding effort is underway. Another issue is the added levels of coordination that occur when working with multiple aid groups to ensure healthcare service coverage. NGO involvement in IDP aid is a fact of life, however. The critical point is that the Ministry of Health must coordinate among those organizations. Much of the focus on healthcare provision during emergency and conflict situations revolves around the use of Mobile Health Units (MHUs). Mobile Health Units are, at their most basic, mobile service units that usually provide specific forms of both preventative and curative care. They are generally expensive, however, and the fact that they only provide services intermittently tends to affect when they are appropriate for use. According to Stephane du Mortier and Rudi Coninx, “In situations of armed conflict, the range of PHC services that can be provided is severely restricted. This means that, in any given situation, it is essential to select the priority services among the spectrum of PHC services”. MHUs are limited in the number of services they can provide and the frequency at which they are available to any one community. These considerations must be kept in mind when formulating a plan as to how to use MHUs in any conflict or emergency setting. Du Mortier and Coninx describe their use of MHUs with the International Committee of the Red Cross during the conflict in Columbia in 2005. In this case, the rebel forces refused to allow access to the Ministry of Health in the country to citizens in areas they held.","In addition, According to N Hakamies, “Although material and human resources are significant constraints on agencies, the main challenge is to tackle ideological, managerial and policy barriers, and those related to donor influence.”","In addition, According to N Hakamies, “Although economic and human resources are significant constraints on development , the primary challenge is to tackle ideological, managerial / policy barriers, / factors related to donor influence.”","LSB"
"203","In comparison to American schools such as those in Los Angeles County, there are schools such as preparatory and some private schools that prepare students early on for SAT. And even fewer public school systems allow for classes and tutoring that is written into the curriculum or that is at the very least affordable for working students of parents. SAT courses such as Kaplan and Princeton Review, while popular, are extremely expensive such as $1000 for average cheap courses. These classes tend to be attended by sophomores, juniors, and senior high school students. In comparison to the juku cram schools in Japan which would be attended from about age 13 during junior high or even earlier and throughout high school. Another important comparison is knowledge of and access to such schools. In Japan, the juku crams schools are expensive. Some schools rate very high for acceptance to top high schools and top universities, while others rate lower on the scale. But nonetheless, the students learn from such schools about standardized testing very early on. The affordability of these schools varies. And juku schools are more of a common knowledge for parents. If a parent in Japan cannot afford or decides not to send their own child to juku, it is likely that the student will know at least some other friends that do attend juku or will at least be given other means through knowledge of the parent to pass exams early on (such as providing textbooks or a private tutor). Juku allows for dangerous competition between students in the face of college entrance. Rohlen mentions that such competition even leads to student suicide at times. Juku systems began as a means of increasing public school comparisons to private schools. The study of juku school systems was recently studied by scholars in the 1980s. The juku focus is on primarily one subject area such as history, language, or science, or math. The school will not focus on details or information such as what may be found outside of the entrance exams. Juku also differ from one another, such as the shingaku juku, where the top students attend, or hoshu juku where the students use the juku school to catch up if they are behind other students in their regular school evaluations. In LA County prep schools for American standardized testing are not always readily available. They are extremely expensive, and the student may even begin to start the classes much too late to learn the material for an exam such as the SAT adequately. In many instances students and parents alike are not taught much about how important the SAT exam is. Because the school system is different in Japan in comparison to the USA, the standardized testing preparation follows that pattern. In Japan standardized testing really drives many important aspects of a student’s future. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> ","In the US a student can do poorly on the SAT and still go to a community college and then graduate from a UC and possibly be admitted to a prestigious university afterwards for a Masters or PhD degree.","In the US a student can score poorly on the SAT and still go to a community school and then withdraw with the UC but possibly be admitted to a prestigious university afterwards for a master or PhD degree.","LSB"

"149","The government has justified the regulation of Monson’s personal production and consumption using a “supply and demand” theory that such personal use can affect the market price of marijuana in the aggregate. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> In addition, this interpretation does not comport with the idea that regulation of the “exclusively internal commerce of a State“ represents what Congress cannot regulate, since it was expressly not enumerated. Accordingly, I would hold that federal regulation of Monson’s personal use and production of medical marijuana in compliance with state law is prohibited by the Constitution, since it represents an attempt to regulate a completely intra-state, non-commercial activity that has no meaningful affect on interstate commerce. Respondent Raich, however, received her marijuana from a third-party, and therefore engaged in commercial activity, so regulation of her conduct cannot be disposed of on grounds that the casual links between the enumerated power and the regulation are too attenuated. Instead, this case presents the more difficult issue of how the Court should balance the “distribution of power [that is] fundamental to our federalist system of government,” when the Commerce Clause challenge involves the competing judicial values of giving deference to the legislative decisions of Congress, with the state’s function of  “serv[ing] as a laboratory; [to] try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.” In an attempt to balance these considerations, I would have held that in situations, like the one presented by the facts of Raich’s case, where Congress is attempting to regulate a local activity, pursuant to a broad regulatory scheme, with no prima facie connection to interstate commerce, and the federal regulation conflicts with a state law that falls within the traditional scope of its general police power, then the determination of Congress’ authority to enact the regulation should not be given the deference of a rational basis review. Instead, it should give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the regulation is not rationally related to the power of regulating interstate commerce. This presumption could be refuted by the factors already established in Morrison and Lopez, by showing express congressional findings concerning the substantial effects of the regulated activity on interstate commerce, as well as indicating an express jurisdictional element that narrowly limits the application of the statute. However, if the statute represented an attempt by Congress to further a compelling national interest, and the government could show that the underlying purpose of the statute would be significantly undermined without the ability to regulate the local activity free from state regulation, then the constitutionality of the statute could be upheld, even without congressional findings or jurisdictional limits.","I do not understand how the majority can logically distinguish this “supply and demand theory” as any less attenuated than the “cost of crime” or “national productivity” arguments that were rejected in Lopez, when the practical affect of accepting this test is abandonment of the idea that there is an “outer limit” on Congress’ Commerce Clause power, if it can regulate the production and possession of a commodity that has never entered, nor ever will enter interstate commerce.","I do not understand how the majority can logically idstniguish this 'supply and demand theory' as anyl ess attenuated than the 'outlay of crime' o r'national productivity' arguments that were rejected in Lopez, when the practical affect of accepting this try is abandonment of the idea that region is an 'outer limit' on Congress' Commerce Clause power, if it can regulate the production and possession of a commodity that has never entered, nor ever will enter interstate commerce.","AStar"
"20","As IDP camps tend to be located in remote, marginal areas, there typically is no easy supply route to avoid stock outs. In Iraq in 2006, for example, only about 30% of clinics reported an adequate supply of essential drugs. A second major issue, and one that has long-term post-conflict implications, is of doctor migration out of the country, also known as the “Brain Drain”. While the “Brain Drain” traditionally occurs due to a lesser-developed country not being able to offer competitive compensation to in-country doctors, conflict can have the same effect. In fact, physician migration has occurred time and time again during unrest in a country. Over half of Cuba's doctors left during the revolution. Zimbabwe lost over two thirds of their physicians in the 1990s. Even in Iraq today, it is estimated that over half of the doctors have left the country, many for Jordan. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> In 2006 alone, 28% of specialists left Baghdad. Other areas of Iraq saw numerous Baghdad doctors relocate to their areas rather than leave the country entirely. Nevertheless, the proportion of doctors who migrated in Iraq is startling. In addition, around 75% of the doctors who have left are expected not to return to Iraq after the conflict is over. In Iraq, the reasons for doctor migration vary, including about 13% who stated they left due to threats of kidnapping or murder. Complicating the “Brain Drain” problem even further is the traditional issue of physician compensation. Even for providers who don't suffer from threats of violence against them, in a place like Iraq today they cannot afford to hold on to the existing doctors. As stated by Agron Ferati in the Brookings Institute's 2009 panel, “Monitoring Health Services among Iraqi Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons,” “Why should I remain in Baghdad as a surgeon, when I can go in Dubai and earn $5,000 salary, while in Baghdad I risk my own life, my family’s lives, for $600 or $700?” This problem only surface in Iraq after the war. This issue is not constrained to only doctors, either. In 2006 it was found that only about 30% of all healthcare staff positions were filled. In a place like Iraq, the “Brain Drain” is a very real issue that threatens long-term health systems stability. Increasing the number of doctors trained in their medical schools is one way to counteract the problem, but in the shorter term, doctor shortage will further contribute to the access issues already facing the country. While everyone in Iraq, even IDPs, have access to healthcare, the quality is sure to suffer, particularly in Baghdad. Another important aspect of health systems in conflict situations is the question of where the financial resources will originate from. Government support in extended conflicts typically wanes, increasing reliance on NGO and bilateral agency funding for health-sector funding.","It should be noted that the doctor loss was most severe in Baghdad, likely due to the intensity of the conflict there.","It should be noted that the loss of doctors was the most serious in Baghdad, probably due to the intensity of the conflict there.","BT"
"146","Increasing antagonism with the US meant that Cuba was also looking to foil American plans abroad, and the Angolan crisis was a perfect opportunity for Cuba to use its strong military to embarrass the US. Fidel Castro initially acted unilaterally and without notifying the Soviets on his intentions in Angola. However, Cuban and Soviet collaboration soon led to highly effective assistance to the MPLA, with the Cubans provided tens of thousands of well-trained soldiers and the Soviets technical expertise and military equipment, particularly in the field of heavy artillery and tanks, which were previously absent in the Angolan theater. By the 1980s, a Soviet investment of $5 billion in military hardware helped lead the MPLA to victory in the war. Weapons provided included “T-34 and T-54 tanks, 100mm guns, 120mm multiple rocket launchers, amphibious vehicles, helicopters equipped with 20mm cannon and air-to-ground rockets” as well as MIG-17 and MIG-21 fighter jets. Soviet and Cuban presence continued until the late 80s when global political changes and the end of the Cold War took away many of the incentives of remaining in Angola. Without Cuban and Soviet backing, the MPLA would have never been able to defeat its opponents, who also had the support of foreign superpowers. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> American oil companies were well established there since the discovery of oil in the 1950s, and in order to protect these interests, the US supported the Portuguese during the liberation war. By the time the Portugal was preparing to leave the continent in 1974, the threat of communist takeover by the MPLA with Cuban and Soviet support influenced the US to fund alternative groups to prevent a communist victory. A Soviet friendly nation in southern Africa might tip the balance of power in favor of the communists and set off more leftist revolutions in the region. Since 1961, the US had been supporting Holden Roberto with a modest stipend of $10,000 a year. In the light of the new situation, this sum was increased to $300,000 in 1975, and throughout that year $35 million was spent on arming the FNLA through airbases in friendly Zaire. US involvement was relatively clandestine at this stage, mostly involving the CIA and indirect aid to the FNLA through Zaire. An American population weary from Vietnam was not willing to enter another bloody Third World conflict so far from home. Despite the official backing of the FNLA, many within the US establishment did not agree with the decision to support the FNLA. Two important US officials in Luanda, Robert W. Hultslander, the CIA station chief, and Tom Killoran, the American Consul General, agreed that the MPLA were the most qualified of the groups to govern and sought peaceful relations with Washington. Hultslander further stated that its leaders “were more effective, better educated, better trained, and better motivated”; by contrast the FNLA “was led by corrupt, unprincipled men who represented the very worst of radical black African racism.”","The initial reasons for United States intervention in Angola were primarily economic.","The initial reasons for the U.S. intervention in Angola were mainly economic.","BT"

I dissent from the majority’s holding that a rational-basis review of Congress’ decision to regulate a “class of activities” that includes local, non-commercial behavior is proper, as long as the regulation is part of a “general regulatory statute [that] bears a substantial relation to commerce,” while also refusing to hear as-applied challenges that would “excise individual applications of a concededly valid statutory scheme,” which effectively abolishes any meaningful limitations on Congress’ power to regulate under the Commerce Clause. Instead, I would have held the CSA unconstitutional as applied to respondent Monson who cultivated and consumed medical marijuana which never entered the stream of commerce, is not a regulation that is rationally related to Congress’ Commerce Clause power, while remanding the question of the constitutionality of regulating Raich’s medical marijuana use, in accordance with the stricter scrutiny test described in this opinion. The respondents have argued that application of the CSA to their “intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by a patient's physician pursuant to valid California state law” is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause. I agree with Justice Scalia in his concurrence, that a necessary and proper clause analysis is necessary because the respondents are challenging the authority of Congress’ implied power to regulate this class of activities, but disagree with his conclusion that regulations of respondent’s activities were “appropriate means of achieving the legitimate end of eradicating Schedule I substances from interstate commerce.” In conducting the necessary and proper clause analysis, I think it is necessary to differentiate between the respondents, since Raich obtained her marijuana from a third-party, while Monson’s production and consumption was entirely personal.","Of course we could not rely on the government alone to prevent this problem, much of what underlines the issue is economic difficulties and public perception that Preservation groups only seek to hinder development.","Of course, we cannot trust the government alone to avoid this problem, many of what the problem emphasizes are economic difficulties and the public perception that conservation groups are just trying to prevent development.","BT"

"49","Students in a Kumon class will not run into a similar problem since these students are only allowed to advance once they meet a requirement of accuracy. There is also Kumon for preschoolers and kindergarten age students. The main website does not seem necessarily tailored to only Asian students (as is the case for juku schools). There are 6 listed Junior Kumon schools throughout Torrance and Gardena (including the surrounding areas of Carson, Rolling Hills, Manhattan and Redondo Beaches, Palos Verdes, and San Pedro) to which Gardena and Torrance residents can easily drive or bus. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> In Japan, Juku is primarily an after school learning system that generally begins after the regular school day and ends at about dinner time nearly every weekday and at times during one or both weekend days depending on the juku campus. Japanese school systems consist of a grade 1-6 elementary system, 1-3 for junior high, and 1-3 for high school. Following junior high school education a Japanese student will take an entrance exam through which the scores determine the quality level of high school education and prestige of high school that the student will be accepted to attend. Upon completion of high school the student will take another entrance exam to enter a prestigious university such as the prized Tokyo University. The high school acceptance gives opportunities to be better prepared for the college entrance. And graduation from a prestigious university affects the access to jobs and other resources as well as social factors. In some more recent cases there are even competitive preschools and kindergartens that prepare students for competition of standardized testing and study habits. Because the Japanese school system in Japan is primarily driven by the ability to score high on standardized tests, students who come from Japan as well as their parents and family members who may move to an area like Torrance or Gardena, California, already have a background in how to accurately achieve high scores on standardized exams. This is one much overlooked reason as to why even international students are able to achieve high SAT scores and later MCAT, GRE, etc. scores. An article about juku in the US showed results that the amount of homework given to students who attended juku was completed about 80-90% compared to the amount of take home assignments that the student was required to turn in. When comparing American juku students (studying in US juku) with Japanese juku students (studying in Japanese juku) it was shown that overall the students in Japan still scored higher possibly due to attitudes of learning, social pressures, and academic relevance and realities of juku in US versus juku in Japan. Gains were greater for public school students who attended extracurricular activities. The schools from high SES background areas tended to show higher standardized testing scores. The author insists that improving scores in schools should start at home in which the parent or caretaker should provide opportunity, interest, and help for a student such as encouragement and strong involvement in academic performance.","There are 5 Kumon schools for older children.","There are 5 Kumon schools for older children.","Orig"

"169","In comparison to American schools such as those in Los Angeles County, there are schools such as preparatory and some private schools that prepare students early on for SAT. And even fewer public school systems allow for classes and tutoring that is written into the curriculum or that is at the very least affordable for working students of parents. SAT courses such as Kaplan and Princeton Review, while popular, are extremely expensive such as $1000 for average cheap courses. These classes tend to be attended by sophomores, juniors, and senior high school students. In comparison to the juku cram schools in Japan which would be attended from about age 13 during junior high or even earlier and throughout high school. Another important comparison is knowledge of and access to such schools. In Japan, the juku crams schools are expensive. Some schools rate very high for acceptance to top high schools and top universities, while others rate lower on the scale. But nonetheless, the students learn from such schools about standardized testing very early on. The affordability of these schools varies. And juku schools are more of a common knowledge for parents. If a parent in Japan cannot afford or decides not to send their own child to juku, it is likely that the student will know at least some other friends that do attend juku or will at least be given other means through knowledge of the parent to pass exams early on (such as providing textbooks or a private tutor). Juku allows for dangerous competition between students in the face of college entrance. Rohlen mentions that such competition even leads to student suicide at times. Juku systems began as a means of increasing public school comparisons to private schools. The study of juku school systems was recently studied by scholars in the 1980s. The juku focus is on primarily one subject area such as history, language, or science, or math. The school will not focus on details or information such as what may be found outside of the entrance exams. Juku also differ from one another, such as the shingaku juku, where the top students attend, or hoshu juku where the students use the juku school to catch up if they are behind other students in their regular school evaluations. In LA County prep schools for American standardized testing are not always readily available. They are extremely expensive, and the student may even begin to start the classes much too late to learn the material for an exam such as the SAT adequately. In many instances students and parents alike are not taught much about how important the SAT exam is.

"41","In addition, According to N Hakamies, “Although material and human resources are significant constraints on agencies, the main challenge is to tackle ideological, managerial and policy barriers, and those related to donor influence.” Finding funding for family planning services continues to prove difficult for NGOs, and as a result they often do not exist or cannot meet the need levels of their constituencies. Reproductive Health funding problems underscore a larger issue with a reliance on NGO services, as can often be seen in IDP situations. The ability to provide services is often reliant on funding from outside sources and its continuation is based not on the needs of those being served, but on what they can find funding to provide. Often an organization's decision to cease operations in a country has more to do with a lack of financial support than the successful completion of their programming. There are certainly other issues with over reliance on NGO services, such as the fact that their services often don't solve the underlying infrastructure issues that will reemerge once the NGO presence is reduced. Many NGOs do not remain in-country for the post-conflict period. In effect, services are provided and once the initial emergency is over, the NGOs are gone and those still displaced must find a health provider somewhere else. This affects a country's capacity to rebuild post-conflict as well as their ability to provide services while the rebuilding effort is underway. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> NGO involvement in IDP aid is a fact of life, however. The critical point is that the Ministry of Health must coordinate among those organizations. Much of the focus on healthcare provision during emergency and conflict situations revolves around the use of Mobile Health Units (MHUs). Mobile Health Units are, at their most basic, mobile service units that usually provide specific forms of both preventative and curative care. They are generally expensive, however, and the fact that they only provide services intermittently tends to affect when they are appropriate for use. According to Stephane du Mortier and Rudi Coninx, “In situations of armed conflict, the range of PHC services that can be provided is severely restricted. This means that, in any given situation, it is essential to select the priority services among the spectrum of PHC services”. MHUs are limited in the number of services they can provide and the frequency at which they are available to any one community. These considerations must be kept in mind when formulating a plan as to how to use MHUs in any conflict or emergency setting. Du Mortier and Coninx describe their use of MHUs with the International Committee of the Red Cross during the conflict in Columbia in 2005. In this case, the rebel forces refused to allow access to the Ministry of Health in the country to citizens in areas they held.","Another issue is the added levels of coordination that occur when working with multiple aid groups to ensure healthcare service coverage.","Another concern is - added levels of coordination that occur when working with multiple aid groups to ensure full service coverage.","LSB"
"q_1","My question dealt with the fact that it takes a certain amount of time for a bone that has a fracture to heal. I stated that the body needs a specific amount of time to transfer calcium from locations in the body to the fracture. I also mentioned that the cells that build up the various tissues found within the bone have to grow and divide and repeat this process until the fracture was knitted. I was concerned because this took time and that it was an actual physical process – there are no shortcuts. Also, I did not understand how a broken bone could be considered not real. Barbara assured me that fractures could heal “instantaneously” and that the body was not limited by time or resources since God was perfect and that matter was not real. I wanted to know how the healing process worked. Within the Church there are two types of healers. One is called a Practitioner and the other type is referred to as a Christian Science Nurse. A Practitioner begins by becoming a member of the Christian Science Church. A member does all the regular things, attends weekly Sunday services and on Wednesday nights twice a month, there are testimonials where members speak about their experiences with healing. Once the member feels that he or she is ready to become a Practitioner, they take a two week-long course. This course is referred to as “The Class.”  Once “The Class” is completed, the member is now a Practitioner and can begin to heal. The Practitioner uses the 700 page Science and Health text as well as Bible verses to discuss with people how to let God (aka “Mind” or “Spirit”) to be reflected accurately in their bodies. These Practitioners set their own fees and can provide services either in person or via the phone. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> The students spend their time analyzing texts, understanding how to explain health concerns from a religious standpoint and praying. “To the Christian Science healer, sickness is a dream from which the patient needs to be awakened.

All treatment that is provided by Christian Science Nurses is nonmedical in nature and includes care such as help with feeding, bathing, assistance with moving (i.e. from bed to chair).

FBI Wants to Expand Internet WiretappingThe FBI, in an effort to keep up with the changing landscape of the Internet, is calling for a push to expand its capabilities in intercepting online evidence. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> According to Ms. Caproni, “In the ever-changing world of modern communications technologies, however, the FBI and other government agencies are facing a potentially widening gap between our legal authority to intercept electronic communications pursuant to court order and our practical ability to actually intercept those communications. As the gap between authority and capability widens, the government is increasingly unable to collect valuable evidence in cases ranging from child exploitation and pornography to organized crime and drug trafficking to terrorism and espionage.” The FBI argues that the current limitations on their wiretapping are antiquated. Many statutes have not been updated since the early nineties. Some of the statutes allow the FBI to read e-mail stored on a local server that is more than six months old. These laws date back to a time when users fetched their mail from a single computer almost daily, so e-mail that had been on a server for six months was considered abandoned. In the age of webmail, users keep most of their emails forever.","Citing advances in “webmail, social networking sites, and peer-to-peer services,” the FBI’s general counsel, Valerie Caproni, addressed Congress to discuss the increasing difficulty in tracing electronic communication in ongoing cases.","Citing advances in “webmail, social networking sites, and peer-to-peer services,” the FBI’s general counsel, Valerie Caproni, addressed Congress to discuss the increasing difficulty in tracing electronic coordination in extra cases.","mutX"
"35","In addition, According to N Hakamies, “Although material and human resources are significant constraints on agencies, the main challenge is to tackle ideological, managerial and policy barriers, and those related to donor influence.” Finding funding for family planning services continues to prove difficult for NGOs, and as a result they often do not exist or cannot meet the need levels of their constituencies. Reproductive Health funding problems underscore a larger issue with a reliance on NGO services, as can often be seen in IDP situations. The ability to provide services is often reliant on funding from outside sources and its continuation is based not on the needs of those being served, but on what they can find funding to provide. Often an organization's decision to cease operations in a country has more to do with a lack of financial support than the successful completion of their programming. There are certainly other issues with over reliance on NGO services, such as the fact that their services often don't solve the underlying infrastructure issues that will reemerge once the NGO presence is reduced. Many NGOs do not remain in-country for the post-conflict period. In effect, services are provided and once the initial emergency is over, the NGOs are gone and those still displaced must find a health provider somewhere else. This affects a country's capacity to rebuild post-conflict as well as their ability to provide services while the rebuilding effort is underway. Another issue is the added levels of coordination that occur when working with multiple aid groups to ensure healthcare service coverage. NGO involvement in IDP aid is a fact of life, however. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Much of the focus on healthcare provision during emergency and conflict situations revolves around the use of Mobile Health Units (MHUs). Mobile Health Units are, at their most basic, mobile service units that usually provide specific forms of both preventative and curative care. They are generally expensive, however, and the fact that they only provide services intermittently tends to affect when they are appropriate for use. According to Stephane du Mortier and Rudi Coninx, “In situations of armed conflict, the range of PHC services that can be provided is severely restricted. This means that, in any given situation, it is essential to select the priority services among the spectrum of PHC services”. MHUs are limited in the number of services they can provide and the frequency at which they are available to any one community. These considerations must be kept in mind when formulating a plan as to how to use MHUs in any conflict or emergency setting. Du Mortier and Coninx describe their use of MHUs with the International Committee of the Red Cross during the conflict in Columbia in 2005. In this case, the rebel forces refused to allow access to the Ministry of Health in the country to citizens in areas they held.","The critical point is that the Ministry of Health must coordinate among those organizations.","its critical point is that the department of Health must coordinate among those organizations.","LSB"

There are 6 listed Junior Kumon schools throughout Torrance and Gardena (including the surrounding areas of Carson, Rolling Hills, Manhattan and Redondo Beaches, Palos Verdes, and San Pedro) to which Gardena and Torrance residents can easily drive or bus. There are 5 Kumon schools for older children. In Japan, Juku is primarily an after school learning system that generally begins after the regular school day and ends at about dinner time nearly every weekday and at times during one or both weekend days depending on the juku campus. Japanese school systems consist of a grade 1-6 elementary system, 1-3 for junior high, and 1-3 for high school. Following junior high school education a Japanese student will take an entrance exam through which the scores determine the quality level of high school education and prestige of high school that the student will be accepted to attend. Upon completion of high school the student will take another entrance exam to enter a prestigious university such as the prized Tokyo University. The high school acceptance gives opportunities to be better prepared for the college entrance. And graduation from a prestigious university affects the access to jobs and other resources as well as social factors. In some more recent cases there are even competitive preschools and kindergartens that prepare students for competition of standardized testing and study habits. Because the Japanese school system in Japan is primarily driven by the ability to score high on standardized tests, students who come from Japan as well as their parents and family members who may move to an area like Torrance or Gardena, California, already have a background in how to accurately achieve high scores on standardized exams. This is one much overlooked reason as to why even international students are able to achieve high SAT scores and later MCAT, GRE, etc. scores. An article about juku in the US showed results that the amount of homework given to students who attended juku was completed about 80-90% compared to the amount of take home assignments that the student was required to turn in. When comparing American juku students (studying in US juku) with Japanese juku students (studying in Japanese juku) it was shown that overall the students in Japan still scored higher possibly due to attitudes of learning, social pressures, and academic relevance and realities of juku in US versus juku in Japan. Gains were greater for public school students who attended extracurricular activities. The schools from high SES background areas tended to show higher standardized testing scores. The author insists that improving scores in schools should start at home in which the parent or caretaker should provide opportunity, interest, and help for a student such as encouragement and strong involvement in academic performance.","There is also Kumon for preschoolers and kindergarten age students.","There is also Kumon for preschoolers and kindergarten age students.","Orig"

Originally, she wanted healers to stay within their own Christian denominations and heal sickness with her method. But, she discovered that her ideas and healing methods were modified too radically by others and she felt that it was important to consolidate into one group and by 1879 she founded this church and a teaching college that was chartered in the State of Massachusetts. One interesting note, there is no established clergy, but rather members who take turns presenting and overseeing events. The Christian Science Church is well known for their reading rooms. These rooms are open to the public and house scriptural references, Christian Science Journals and magazines as well as Bibles and other study materials. One Saturday, I met with Barbara H. at the Christian Science Reading Room at 10 West 68th Street in Manhattan. The interior had two levels, the street level being where the church was located and the lower level housing the reading room. Immediately it reminded me of all churches – dark lighting, the smell of old books, wood and brass fixtures, and religious pastoral scene prints and sayings in frames on the walls. For some reason, I had envisioned it in my mind as more modern and less like the Lutheran Church I had gone to in Ohio in my youth. Barbara asked me questions at first and when she found out I was studying science at school, she asked me if I had seen the movie “What the Bleep do we Know.”  She also brought up how in Physics, especially in Quantum Physics, scientists are beginning to question what matter is and the scientist’s role when dealing with this concept. We began to discuss what matter was in terms of Christian Science practice. According to Christian Science, matter is not real. The only thing that is real is God. God is also referred to as “Mind” or “Spirit.”  Matter therefore is a reflection. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Since God is perfect, this reflection, which is matter, has to be perfect. If matter is not perfect, it is a human’s mind (not to be confused with “Mind” which is God,) which is incorrectly perceiving this reflection. To be healed of disease, first a person must believe that matter is not real and therefore diseases do not exist. In a sense, they are a figment of a person’s imagination. “Maintain the facts of Christian Science, - that Spirit is God, and therefore cannot be sick; that what is termed matter cannot be sick; that all causation is Mind, acting through spiritual law.” (Science and Health p. 417)Since some diseases could be viewed as psychosomatic or a chemical imbalance, I wanted a question about an ailment that would be one or the other.

"159","Further south in the central highlands, the primary commercial crop was cotton, and British and Portuguese cotton plantations displaced the native Ovimbundu. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> The employment of Ovimbundu on land formerly occupied by Bakongo farmers created tensions between the two groups. Furthermore as they were largely employed in lowly paid plantation work, the Ovimbundu occupied the low end of the economic scale, being scorned by both the Bakongo and Mbundu as crude and subservient. The animosity displayed by the other ethnic groups toward the Ovimbundu caused many of them to reject the two dominant nationalist groups, the FNLA and MPLA, during the liberation war, in favor of UNITA, an explicitly Ovimbundu-based organization. The continued fragmentation of its nationalist movements set Angola apart from other Portuguese colonies. In Mozambique Julius Nyerere united the various factions under the banner of FRELIMO, and Amílcar Cabral convinced the assimilados of Cape Verde and the peasants of Guinea-Bissau to unite as PAIGC. In both of these situations, the rebel groups fought successful united campaigns against the Portuguese and were on the verge of victory at the time of independence. By contrast, no single nationalist movement in Angola was able to unite the various rebel factions in the struggle against Portugal for independence, and the three major groups that came to dominate the fourteen-year liberation war often fought each other as much as the Portuguese. The Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) was initially formed in the late 1950s by a young group of Angolans studying in Lisbon and Paris, including Lúcio Lara, Agostinho Neto, Mário de Andrade, and José Eduardo dos Santos (Neto’s successor and the current president of Angola). Counting urban mestiços and assimilados, in addition to some liberal whites among its ranks, the MPLA was explicitly inclusive and set out to unite Angolans of different ethnic, religious, and regional backgrounds into one independence movement. Many of the founders had been members of the Communist Party of Angola (PCA) and a Marxist class-based ideology was adopted by the movement, partially as a uniting force for a group without a strong ethnic or regional base. Despite this, the MPLA initially struggled to build popular support. Many Angolans were suspicious of the MPLA, which represented the old mestiço and assimilado elite of the coastal cities and had a history of dominating the largely rural populations of the interior. Rival groups like the FNLA highlighted this distrust by publicly condemning the MPLA as out of touch with the peasants that made up 93% of the Angolan population. They further stated that an independent Angola under the MPLA would be dominated by urban mestiços and assimilados, effectively transferring power from one class of colonial masters to another.","Unlike the Bakongo farmers of the north who largely stayed together and settled in Zaire, the Ovimbundu dispersed in all directions, some remained in the area to work the cotton fields, while others migrated north to work on the coffee plantations or south to less populated areas.","Unlike the Bakongo farmers of the north who largely stayed together and settled in Zaire, the Ovimbundu dispersed in all directions, some remained in the region to work the cotton fields, while others migrated north to work on the coffee plantations or south to less populated areas, The employment of Ovimbundu on land formerly occupied by Bakongo farmers created tensions between the two groups.","AStar"
"185","As IDP camps tend to be located in remote, marginal areas, there typically is no easy supply route to avoid stock outs. In Iraq in 2006, for example, only about 30% of clinics reported an adequate supply of essential drugs. A second major issue, and one that has long-term post-conflict implications, is of doctor migration out of the country, also known as the “Brain Drain”. While the “Brain Drain” traditionally occurs due to a lesser-developed country not being able to offer competitive compensation to in-country doctors, conflict can have the same effect. In fact, physician migration has occurred time and time again during unrest in a country. Over half of Cuba's doctors left during the revolution. Zimbabwe lost over two thirds of their physicians in the 1990s. Even in Iraq today, it is estimated that over half of the doctors have left the country, many for Jordan. It should be noted that the doctor loss was most severe in Baghdad, likely due to the intensity of the conflict there. In 2006 alone, 28% of specialists left Baghdad. Other areas of Iraq saw numerous Baghdad doctors relocate to their areas rather than leave the country entirely. Nevertheless, the proportion of doctors who migrated in Iraq is startling. In addition, around 75% of the doctors who have left are expected not to return to Iraq after the conflict is over. In Iraq, the reasons for doctor migration vary, including about 13% who stated they left due to threats of kidnapping or murder. Complicating the “Brain Drain” problem even further is the traditional issue of physician compensation. Even for providers who don't suffer from threats of violence against them, in a place like Iraq today they cannot afford to hold on to the existing doctors. As stated by Agron Ferati in the Brookings Institute's 2009 panel, “Monitoring Health Services among Iraqi Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons,” “Why should I remain in Baghdad as a surgeon, when I can go in Dubai and earn $5,000 salary, while in Baghdad I risk my own life, my family’s lives, for $600 or $700?” This problem only surface in Iraq after the war. This issue is not constrained to only doctors, either. In 2006 it was found that only about 30% of all healthcare staff positions were filled. In a place like Iraq, the “Brain Drain” is a very real issue that threatens long-term health systems stability. Increasing the number of doctors trained in their medical schools is one way to counteract the problem, but in the shorter term, doctor shortage will further contribute to the access issues already facing the country. While everyone in Iraq, even IDPs, have access to healthcare, the quality is sure to suffer, particularly in Baghdad.

However, Cuban and Soviet collaboration soon led to highly effective assistance to the MPLA, with the Cubans provided tens of thousands of well-trained soldiers and the Soviets technical expertise and military equipment, particularly in the field of heavy artillery and tanks, which were previously absent in the Angolan theater. By the 1980s, a Soviet investment of $5 billion in military hardware helped lead the MPLA to victory in the war. Weapons provided included “T-34 and T-54 tanks, 100mm guns, 120mm multiple rocket launchers, amphibious vehicles, helicopters equipped with 20mm cannon and air-to-ground rockets” as well as MIG-17 and MIG-21 fighter jets. Soviet and Cuban presence continued until the late 80s when global political changes and the end of the Cold War took away many of the incentives of remaining in Angola. Without Cuban and Soviet backing, the MPLA would have never been able to defeat its opponents, who also had the support of foreign superpowers. The initial reasons for United States intervention in Angola were primarily economic. American oil companies were well established there since the discovery of oil in the 1950s, and in order to protect these interests, the US supported the Portuguese during the liberation war. By the time the Portugal was preparing to leave the continent in 1974, the threat of communist takeover by the MPLA with Cuban and Soviet support influenced the US to fund alternative groups to prevent a communist victory. A Soviet friendly nation in southern Africa might tip the balance of power in favor of the communists and set off more leftist revolutions in the region. Since 1961, the US had been supporting Holden Roberto with a modest stipend of $10,000 a year. In the light of the new situation, this sum was increased to $300,000 in 1975, and throughout that year $35 million was spent on arming the FNLA through airbases in friendly Zaire. US involvement was relatively clandestine at this stage, mostly involving the CIA and indirect aid to the FNLA through Zaire. An American population weary from Vietnam was not willing to enter another bloody Third World conflict so far from home. Despite the official backing of the FNLA, many within the US establishment did not agree with the decision to support the FNLA. Two important US officials in Luanda, Robert W. Hultslander, the CIA station chief, and Tom Killoran, the American Consul General, agreed that the MPLA were the most qualified of the groups to govern and sought peaceful relations with Washington. Hultslander further stated that its leaders “were more effective, better educated, better trained, and better motivated”; by contrast the FNLA “was led by corrupt, unprincipled men who represented the very worst of radical black African racism.”","Increasing antagonism with the US meant that Cuba was also looking to foil American plans abroad, and the Angolan crisis was a perfect opportunity for Cuba to use its strong military to embarrass the US.","The increased antagonism against the United States meant that Cuba also sought U.S. plans abroad, and the Angola crisis was a perfect opportunity for Cuba to use its military forces to scare the United States.","BT"

On the surface, the masses comment on certain Asian student groups (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean students) as being smarter than other American ethnic minority populations and as scoring higher or equal to Anglo Americans on standardized tests. As many current ethnic studies courses teach, it is not a nationality or an ethnicity that one is born into that determines grades, study habits, test scores, education levels and job opportunities but it is rather cultural advice and traditions that give rise to how a parent makes use of resources for their child’s education. The educational systems in many Asian countries differ greatly from those in the United States; there are many countries that demand high standardized exam scores from a student in order for graduation and advancement to the next stage of schooling (such as middle school to high school and high school to college). Because of the demands of these school systems, the students are expected to not only score good in classes, but to learn how to take standardized exams very well.","While Yerba Mate has about a third the amount of caffeine as coffee, it tends to make me very alert and focused on whatever the task is I need to complete.","In addition, community clinics were handed over to the communities to manage, as the federal government did not have adequate resources to manage them during the conflict.","atten"

The ability to provide services is often reliant on funding from outside sources and its continuation is based not on the needs of those being served, but on what they can find funding to provide. Often an organization's decision to cease operations in a country has more to do with a lack of financial support than the successful completion of their programming. There are certainly other issues with over reliance on NGO services, such as the fact that their services often don't solve the underlying infrastructure issues that will reemerge once the NGO presence is reduced. Many NGOs do not remain in-country for the post-conflict period. In effect, services are provided and once the initial emergency is over, the NGOs are gone and those still displaced must find a health provider somewhere else. This affects a country's capacity to rebuild post-conflict as well as their ability to provide services while the rebuilding effort is underway. Another issue is the added levels of coordination that occur when working with multiple aid groups to ensure healthcare service coverage. NGO involvement in IDP aid is a fact of life, however. The critical point is that the Ministry of Health must coordinate among those organizations. Much of the focus on healthcare provision during emergency and conflict situations revolves around the use of Mobile Health Units (MHUs). Mobile Health Units are, at their most basic, mobile service units that usually provide specific forms of both preventative and curative care. They are generally expensive, however, and the fact that they only provide services intermittently tends to affect when they are appropriate for use. According to Stephane du Mortier and Rudi Coninx, “In situations of armed conflict, the range of PHC services that can be provided is severely restricted. This means that, in any given situation, it is essential to select the priority services among the spectrum of PHC services”. MHUs are limited in the number of services they can provide and the frequency at which they are available to any one community. These considerations must be kept in mind when formulating a plan as to how to use MHUs in any conflict or emergency setting. Du Mortier and Coninx describe their use of MHUs with the International Committee of the Red Cross during the conflict in Columbia in 2005. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> ","In this case, the rebel forces refused to allow access to the Ministry of Health in the country to citizens in areas they held.","In this case, the rebel forces refused to allow access to the Ministry of Health in the country even citizens .","LSB"
"112","Increasing antagonism with the US meant that Cuba was also looking to foil American plans abroad, and the Angolan crisis was a perfect opportunity for Cuba to use its strong military to embarrass the US. Fidel Castro initially acted unilaterally and without notifying the Soviets on his intentions in Angola. However, Cuban and Soviet collaboration soon led to highly effective assistance to the MPLA, with the Cubans provided tens of thousands of well-trained soldiers and the Soviets technical expertise and military equipment, particularly in the field of heavy artillery and tanks, which were previously absent in the Angolan theater. By the 1980s, a Soviet investment of $5 billion in military hardware helped lead the MPLA to victory in the war. Weapons provided included “T-34 and T-54 tanks, 100mm guns, 120mm multiple rocket launchers, amphibious vehicles, helicopters equipped with 20mm cannon and air-to-ground rockets” as well as MIG-17 and MIG-21 fighter jets. Soviet and Cuban presence continued until the late 80s when global political changes and the end of the Cold War took away many of the incentives of remaining in Angola. Without Cuban and Soviet backing, the MPLA would have never been able to defeat its opponents, who also had the support of foreign superpowers. The initial reasons for United States intervention in Angola were primarily economic. American oil companies were well established there since the discovery of oil in the 1950s, and in order to protect these interests, the US supported the Portuguese during the liberation war. By the time the Portugal was preparing to leave the continent in 1974, the threat of communist takeover by the MPLA with Cuban and Soviet support influenced the US to fund alternative groups to prevent a communist victory. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> Since 1961, the US had been supporting Holden Roberto with a modest stipend of $10,000 a year. In the light of the new situation, this sum was increased to $300,000 in 1975, and throughout that year $35 million was spent on arming the FNLA through airbases in friendly Zaire. US involvement was relatively clandestine at this stage, mostly involving the CIA and indirect aid to the FNLA through Zaire. An American population weary from Vietnam was not willing to enter another bloody Third World conflict so far from home. Despite the official backing of the FNLA, many within the US establishment did not agree with the decision to support the FNLA. Two important US officials in Luanda, Robert W. Hultslander, the CIA station chief, and Tom Killoran, the American Consul General, agreed that the MPLA were the most qualified of the groups to govern and sought peaceful relations with Washington. Hultslander further stated that its leaders “were more effective, better educated, better trained, and better motivated”; by contrast the FNLA “was led by corrupt, unprincipled men who represented the very worst of radical black African racism.”","A Soviet friendly nation in southern Africa might tip the balance of power in favor of the communists and set off more leftist revolutions in the region.","A Soviet friendly nation in southern Africa might tip the balance of power in favor of the communists and set off more leftist revolutions in the region.","Orig"

I stated that the body needs a specific amount of time to transfer calcium from locations in the body to the fracture. I also mentioned that the cells that build up the various tissues found within the bone have to grow and divide and repeat this process until the fracture was knitted. I was concerned because this took time and that it was an actual physical process – there are no shortcuts. Also, I did not understand how a broken bone could be considered not real. Barbara assured me that fractures could heal “instantaneously” and that the body was not limited by time or resources since God was perfect and that matter was not real. I wanted to know how the healing process worked. Within the Church there are two types of healers. One is called a Practitioner and the other type is referred to as a Christian Science Nurse. A Practitioner begins by becoming a member of the Christian Science Church. A member does all the regular things, attends weekly Sunday services and on Wednesday nights twice a month, there are testimonials where members speak about their experiences with healing. Once the member feels that he or she is ready to become a Practitioner, they take a two week-long course. This course is referred to as “The Class.”  Once “The Class” is completed, the member is now a Practitioner and can begin to heal. The Practitioner uses the 700 page Science and Health text as well as Bible verses to discuss with people how to let God (aka “Mind” or “Spirit”) to be reflected accurately in their bodies. These Practitioners set their own fees and can provide services either in person or via the phone. <span id='here'><strong><mark> <---- Original Sentence was here ----> </mark></strong></span> The students spend their time analyzing texts, understanding how to explain health concerns from a religious standpoint and praying. “To the Christian Science healer, sickness is a dream from which the patient needs to be awakened.

A Swiss- and Portuguese-educated Angolan émigré of Ovimbundu descent, Savimbi was for a time a member on the FNLA but left the organization in 1964. The Mbundu and Bakongo ethnic groups dominated the MPLA and FNLA leadership, while the largest group, the Ovimbundu, had limited representation. Seeking to create a nationalist movement for his own people, Savimbi formed UNITA, basing his power among the Ovimbundu capital of Huambo. UNITA received aid from the US and South Africa for most of its existence and espoused an anti-communist agenda, though Savimbi had himself been a Marxist at one time. After being defeated right after independence UNITA retreated deep into the Angolan bush and built up an army of several thousand men with fanatically loyal officers. Savimbi’s charisma and previous training in China helped him build an effective fighting force that challenged the MPLA for over twenty-five years. However, the fact that UNITA was built around Savimbi meant that after his death the movement disintegrated.

"175","Throughout the time she was writing the text, she was healing sickness and teaching others how to heal through her method. Originally, she wanted healers to stay within their own Christian denominations and heal sickness with her method. But, she discovered that her ideas and healing methods were modified too radically by others and she felt that it was important to consolidate into one group and by 1879 she founded this church and a teaching college that was chartered in the State of Massachusetts. One interesting note, there is no established clergy, but rather members who take turns presenting and overseeing events. The Christian Science Church is well known for their reading rooms. These rooms are open to the public and house scriptural references, Christian Science Journals and magazines as well as Bibles and other study materials. One Saturday, I met with Barbara H. at the Christian Science Reading Room at 10 West 68th Street in Manhattan. The interior had two levels, the street level being where the church was located and the lower level housing the reading room. Immediately it reminded me of all churches – dark lighting, the smell of old books, wood and brass fixtures, and religious pastoral scene prints and sayings in frames on the walls. For some reason, I had envisioned it in my mind as more modern and less like the Lutheran Church I had gone to in Ohio in my youth. Barbara asked me questions at first and when she found out I was studying science at school, she asked me if I had seen the movie “What the Bleep do we Know.”  She also brought up how in Physics, especially in Quantum Physics, scientists are beginning to question what matter is and the scientist’s role when dealing with this concept.

God is also referred to as “Mind” or “Spirit.”  Matter therefore is a reflection. What matter is a reflection of is, is God. Since God is perfect, this reflection, which is matter, has to be perfect. If matter is not perfect, it is a human’s mind (not to be confused with “Mind” which is God,) which is incorrectly perceiving this reflection. To be healed of disease, first a person must believe that matter is not real and therefore diseases do not exist. In a sense, they are a figment of a person’s imagination. “Maintain the facts of Christian Science, - that Spirit is God, and therefore cannot be sick; that what is termed matter cannot be sick; that all causation is Mind, acting through spiritual law.” (Science and Health p. 417)Since some diseases could be viewed as psychosomatic or a chemical imbalance, I wanted a question about an ailment that would be one or the other.
